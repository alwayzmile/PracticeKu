# PracticeKu
This repository contains my struggle in learning programming
and problem solving in various cases and programming languages.
I don't know if it would be useful for others, but my reason for doing this is
because I love to organize my practice and watch the improvement that I have
made over time. That's why I think GitHub is a nice place for this.
